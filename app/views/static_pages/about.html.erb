<h2>About AirCasting</h2>
<p>AirCasting is a platform for recording, mapping, and sharing health and environmental data using your smartphone. Each AirCasting session lets you capture real-world measurements, annotate the data to tell your story, and share it via the CrowdMap.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&amp;hl=en">AirCasting Android app</a>, AirCasters can record, map, and share:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sound levels recorded by their phone microphone;</li>
  <li>Temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations recorded by the <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/">Arduino-powered AirBeam2</a>;</li>
  <li>Temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) gas concentrations recorded by the <a href="http://habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/HowToBuildAnAirCastingAirMonitor.pdf">Arduino-powered AirCasting Air Monitor</a>;</li>
  <li>Heart rate, heart rate variability, R to R, breathing rate, activity level, peak acceleration and core temperature measurements recorded by the Zephyr BioHarness 3; and</li>
  <li>Heart rate measurements recorded by the Zephyr HxM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/AirCasting-LiteBeam/">AirCasting Luminescence</a>, these sensor streams can also be represented using LED lights.</p>
<p>To start recording, mapping, and sharing sound level data for your neighborhood, simply download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&amp;hl=en">Air­Casting app</a> to your Android device and press record.  Want to record Air Quality data? <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/">Buy an AirBeam2</a>, download the  <a href="http://habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/HowToBuildAnAirCastingAirMonitor.pdf">AirCasting Air Monitor DIY guide</a>, or build your own monitor and connect it to the AirCasting platform. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>AirCasting is an open source project. The <a href="https://github.com/habitatmap">AirCasting app and website code</a> is on GitHub as is the <a href="https://github.com/HabitatMap/AirCastingAndroidClient/tree/master/arduino/aircasting/Airbeam2_Firmware_3_19_18">AirBeam2 Firmware</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/HabitatMap/AirBeam2ElectronicSchematics">electronic schematics for the AirBeam2</a>. The STL files for 3D printing the <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/aircasting">AirBeam2 & LiteBeam enclosures</a> can be downloaded from Shapeways.</p>
<h2>How to Use the AirCasting Maps</h2>
<p>The health and environmental data collected by AirCasters can be viewed via the AirCasting website’s “Maps” page. Along the upper right hand corner of the Maps page there are three tabs: “Fixed”, “Mobile”, and “CrowdMap”. Each of these tabs provides a unique way of viewing and exploring the AirCasting data.</p>
<p>The Fixed and Mobile tabs display data from individual AirCasting instruments that are either stationary (Fixed) or moving (Mobile). The data collected by AirCasters is organized into sessions, with each session representing a batch of measurements that we’re either collected in the same location (if it’s a Fixed session) or during a set period of time (if it’s a Mobile session). Measurements from Fixed sessions are available in real-time and updated every minute, whereas measurements from mobile sessions are available at the conclusion of a recording session.</p>
<p>To view a session, select a session from the “Sessions List” located on the left hand side of the page. A dot’s color corresponds to a measurement’s intensity at that location. Refer to the “Heat Legend Units” to identify the intensity range for a measurement. For example, a yellow dot corresponds to a sound level measurement between 61 and 70 decibels. Note that the relationship between measurement ranges and colors can be adjusted using the “Heat Legend Units” filter. Hover your mouse over a dot to generate a tooltip with the exact measurement. Filter the AirCasting Sessions list by “Parameter”, “Sensor”, “Location”, “Time Range”, “Tags”, or “Profile Names”. Click “submit” to refresh the Sessions list. To view multiple sessions at once, you must first select a “Parameter” and “Sensor”. To graph the measurements from a single session, toggle the “Sessions Graph” arrow at the bottom of the screen. Hover your mouse over the graph to see the corresponding location on the map along with the measurement for that time period. Zoom in on the graph by clicking and dragging with your mouse or clicking the time frame buttons at the top of the graph. When zoomed in, pan through the data using the slider at the bottom of the graph.</p>
<p>The CrowdMap tab displays AirCasting data from all Mobile sessions. Each square’s color corresponds to the average intensity of all the measurements recorded in that area. Click on a square to view the underlying data. Refer to the “Heat Legend Units” to identify the intensity range for a square. For example, an orange square corresponds to an average sound level between 71 and 80 decibels. If no colors are displayed, there’s no data in that area. Note that the relationship between measurement ranges and colors can be adjusted using the “Heat Legend Units” filter. By default, the CrowdMap displays PM2.5 data from the AirBeam2. To view data from other sensors, use the “Parameter” and “Sensor” filters. You can also filter the CrowdMap by “Location”, “Time Range”, “Tags”, or “Profile Names”. Increase the “CrowdMap Resolution” to display averages for smaller areas. Click “submit” to display your filter selections.</p>
<p>To get a better view of the map, hide page elements by toggling the arrow in the upper right hand corner. Generate and share a permalink using the permalink button in the upper right hand corner or simply copy and paste the address from the browser window.</p>
